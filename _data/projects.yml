# Thesis
- project: Design of DPA-Resistant Integrated Circuits
  role: Thesis Research Topic
  # url: "#"
  description: Over the course of my thesis work, I tested various flip-flop configurations for their ability to resist Differential Power Analysis (DPA) attacks. Further, I incorporated the most secure flip-flop style in conjunction with a custom standard cell library into a design flow to enable synthesis and PnR of secure circuits.

#LE Algo
- project: Implementation of a Channel Routing Algorithm
  # url: "#"
  description: A C++ Implementation of the Left-Edge algorithm (with dogleg-routing) for channel routing given a netlist of connections.

#KL Algo
- project: Implementation of Graph Partitioning Heuristic
  # url: "#"
  description: A C++ Implementation of the Kernighan-Lin Heuristic to partition a graph with minimum cost (interconnections between the split partitions), given a netlist of connections.
  
  #Power Analysis
- project: Power analysis using Synopsys utilities
  # url: "#"
  description: Used Design Compiler and Power Compiler to analyze circuit power consumption. Further, used clock gating and Multi-voltage Design (Static Voltage Scaling) for power reduction.
  
  #Scan Chain Insertion
- project: Scan Chain Insertion
  # url: "#"
  description: Inserted an internal scan chain into a given design(booth multiplier ). Used Synopsys DFT compiler for scan chain insertion and generated test patterns using Tetramax ATPG.
  
  #Interconnect NW
- project: Design of a 10x10 interconnect network IC
  # url: "#"
  description: Used the layout tool MAGIC to design a custom bit-sliced 10x10 interconnect network inside a padframe. The IC was fabricated.
